 .DCR (Director Compressed Resource) files created using the authoring tool Adobe Director.

http://helpx.adobe.com/director/kb/common-questions-director.html#main_export

Director files are saved with the DIR extension and can be opened and edited on either the Macintosh or Windows platform from within Director. In addition once a file or project has been completed it can be saved as a DXR which is a read-only, uneditable version of the DIR. Director projectors are executable versions of a Director file. Projectors include the Director runtime engine inside and therefore do not require installation of a plug-in. Projectors have the extension EXE on Windows. On Macintosh, projectors have no extension by default. A DCR is a Shockwave version of a DIR published via Director. Director casts can be saved as a regular Director cast, CST, a protected Director cast, CXT, or a Shockwave cast, CCT. In addition Director can export to digital video: MOV on Macintosh and AVI or MOV on Windows computers.

Windows and Mac, still supported.
I installed v12/64it and an example played fine, in Chrome.
