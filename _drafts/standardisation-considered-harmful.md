My concern is interoperability and preservation. I don't get to choose which implementations people use.

Seem like ISO PDF is to Adobe PDF as W3C HTML is to WHATWG HTML.

Aside from the fact that ISO paywalls their standards instead of making them freely available.
although for ISO 32000-1/PDF-1.7 Adobe made the spec available. Not sure if they'll do the same for the next version
